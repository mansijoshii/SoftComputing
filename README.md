# SoftComputing
A collection of the programs done in my soft computing course

Part 1 : Rough Set Theory
This program takes as input a given decision table and returns the equivalence classes, the lower approximation and the upper approximation as per the rough set theory.

Part 2 : Baum Welch Algorithm
This algorith is used to solve one of the three standard problems of Hidden Markov Models (HMM), i.e, given an observation sequence, train the parameters of the HMM s.t the probability of obtaining the observation sequence is maximum.

Part 3 : Ant Colony Optimisation
It is a famous method used for solving optimisation problems and takes inspiration from ant colonies. I have solved the problem of obtaining an optimum sequence of courses a student should opt s.t 
  1. The credits obtained is maximised
  2. The difficulty is minimised
under the constraints of obtaining certain minimum credits within a given time.
